## Features

- Cache data using Redis as a caching provider
- Store and retrieve objects in Redis
- Use Redis as a message broker for pub/sub messaging
- Support for Redis transactions and pipeline operations

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- Redis Server (running locally or accessible remotely)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hanmant6462/spring-boot-redis-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd spring-boot-redis-project
   ```

3. Build the application using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

## Configuration

Before running the application, you need to configure the Redis connection properties:

1. Open the `application.properties` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory.

2. Replace the placeholders with your Redis server properties:

   ```properties
   spring.redis.host=localhost
   spring.redis.port=6379
   ```

   Optionally, you can configure other Redis properties such as password, SSL, etc.

## Usage

After configuring Redis connection properties, you can run the Spring Boot application using the following command:

```bash
java -jar target/spring-boot-redis-project.jar
```

The application will start, and you can interact with it by accessing the API endpoints or using Redis commands.

## Examples

Here are some examples of common usage scenarios:

- Cache data using Redis as a caching provider
- Store and retrieve objects in Redis using Spring Data Redis repositories
- Publish and subscribe to messages using Redis pub/sub messaging
